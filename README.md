Identifies faces and tries to reverse away from them using Newton's third law of motion, propelling airsoft bbs in order to quickly escape the danger zone.

***(It is definitely NOT a gun with facial detection!)***

Optionally, there can be a stepper motor attached to the thruster. This would require additional code as our team didn't have the option to implement it due to weight constraints.
